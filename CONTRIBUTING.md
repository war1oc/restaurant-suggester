# Contribution Guide

This document provides a contribution guide for the project.

## Get Started

Fork the repository and issue pull requests when work is done.

Peer reviews are highly appreciated, leave comments and start discussions on PRs.

## Commits

```md
Capitalized, short (80 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 120 characters or so. In some contexts, the first
line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body. The blank line separating the
summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run
the two together.
Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches
up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too
```

## Code Convention

Must use **editorconfig** in the editor or IDE to comply with the code convention.
